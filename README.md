## Scenario
You are working in the marketing department or at a Marketing Agency, and your goal is to detect the most important individuals to target within a limited budget. This homework involves analyzing a social network to help marketing specialists decide whom to target.

## Tasks
1. **Create a Directed Graph:**
   - Use the provided `connections.txt` file to create a directed graph.

2. **Identify Bridges:**
   - Detect and list the nodes that act as bridges in the network.

3. **Graph Density:**
   - Calculate and show the density of the graph. Provide commentary on your findings.

4. **Node Connections:**
   - Identify nodes with the highest and lowest number of connections.

5. **Incoming and Outgoing Connections:**
   - Highlight nodes with the highest incoming and outgoing connections.

6. **Centrality Measures:**
   - Determine nodes with the highest closeness, betweenness, and eigenvector centrality. Interpret your findings.

7. **Community Detection:**
   - Implement a community detection algorithm on the directed graph. Display the number of communities created.

8. **Largest and Smallest Community:**
   - Present information about the largest and smallest communities. Provide interpretations.

9. **Draw and Remove Top Nodes:**
   - Select the largest three communities and draw them. Remove the top 3 nodes with the highest Degree Centrality, Closeness Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and Eigenvector Centrality. Each should be in a separate plot/draw.

10. **Draw Influencers:**
    - Draw the influencers of the top 3 communities.

11. **Design an Action Plan:**
    - a. Use a hypothetical business (e.g., telecom, marketing agency).
